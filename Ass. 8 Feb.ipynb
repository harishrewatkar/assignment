    "Ans : Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details from the user while exposing only the relevant information. It is a fundamental concept that allows developers to build complex software systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Abstraction allows for easier maintenance, reusability, and modification of code.\n",

    "For example, consider a car. As a driver, you do not need to know how the car's engine works, how the transmission shifts gears, or how the brake system operates. All you need to know is how to operate the gas pedal, the brake pedal, and the steering wheel. In this example, the car's internal components are abstracted away from the user, allowing the user to interact with only the necessary components."

    "Answer : Abstraction refers to the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details from the user while exposing only the relevant information. It is about creating a simplified view of a system that allows users to interact with it in a meaningful way. Abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract classes and interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the practice of keeping implementation details hidden from the user. It is about bundling data and methods together into a single unit, or class, and controlling access to that unit through the use of access modifiers. Encapsulation helps to prevent users from accidentally modifying data or calling methods that they shouldn't be able to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the difference between abstraction and encapsulation, consider the example of a car. The car can be thought of as an object with various properties (e.g. color, make, model) and methods (e.g. accelerate, brake, turn). Abstraction would involve hiding the implementation details of the car's internal workings, such as the engine and transmission, from the user. The user does not need to know how these systems work; they only need to know how to interact with the car in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, on the other hand, would involve bundling the car's properties and methods together into a single unit, or class, and controlling access to that class through the use of access modifiers. For example, the car's engine and transmission might be encapsulated within a class called \"Engine\" that is not accessible to the user. The user would only be able to interact with the car through its public methods, such as \"accelerate\" and \"brake.\""

    "No, we cannot create an instance of an abstract class in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly because it contains one or more abstract methods. Abstract methods are methods that are declared in the abstract class but do not have an implementation. Instead, their implementation is deferred to the subclasses that inherit from the abstract class.\n",
    "Because an abstract class is incomplete and contains one or more abstract methods, attempting to create an instance of the abstract class would result in an error. In other words, an abstract class serves as a blueprint for the classes that inherit from it and provides a structure for those classes to follow.\n",
    "However, we can create objects of a subclass that extends the abstract class. The subclass must provide implementations for all the abstract methods of the abstract class. This subclass will have access to all the non-abstract methods and fields defined in the abstract class, as well as the ones it defines on its own."
